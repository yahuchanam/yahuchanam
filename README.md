# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I've been immersed in technology for over 20 years, witnessing the evolution of frontend development from monoliths to microfrontends and distributed architectures such as module federation. Specializing in Angular, I focus on performance, scalability, and user experience, delivering clean, maintainable code that drives results.

Let's connect and create impactful digital experiences together.
